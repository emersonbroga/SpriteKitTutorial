A simple SpriteKitTutorial (iOS 7) 

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emersonbroga/SpriteKitTutorial/master/example.gif)


This is a simple example of how to use the SpriteKit Framework, using nodes, scenes, physics and collisions.


This project was written in Objective-c not Swift (sorry guys!)

This project was made following the steps of [J.B.J. Programming](https://www.youtube.com/user/JBJProgramming/) Videos
